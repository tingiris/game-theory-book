# Project Brief

I'll be using ChatGPT to create a full-length book - targeting around ~200 pages. The topic is game theory, and the target audience is entrepreneurs - more narrowly solopreneurs. 

## General Approach

I'm going to be creating a number of prompts and scripts to automate the entire process. But before automating anything, I'll just be using ChatGPT to engineer and test the prompts. For starters, I'm breaking the process down into the following steps. Each step will represent a new ChatGPT thread (a new chat).

1. Prompt for a title and subtitle
2. Prompt for a long and short description
3. Generate a book outline with chapters
4. Expanded the outline for each chapter (each done with a new thread)
5. Generate an introduction for each chapter (each done with a new thread)
6. Prompt to write the text for each chapter section - one section at a time but all done with one thread.

## Step 1: Prompt for a title and subtitle

There are a lot of books about game theory. I'm going to try and differentiate by focusing on a narrower target market - solopreneurs. So, this is a book about game theory for solopreneurs. Here is the prompt I'm using to brainstorm title ideas.

```
I'm working on a book that will teach solopreneurs about game theory essentials. Can you help me brainstorm some book title ideas?
```

## Step 2: Prompt for a long and short description

The end goal is to publish the book on Amazon.com. For that, I'll need a long description (4000 characters or less) and a short description (XXX characters or less).

Here is the prompt I'm using for the long description.

```
I'm working on a book that will teach solopreneurs about game theory. The title is: Winning Alone: Game Theory Essentails for Solopreneurs. It's an introductory-level book that will focus on high-level game theory concepts. Can you write a brief introduction for the book - 4000 characters or less? Also, avoid using filler words, unnecessary words, and fluff words - keep it direct and succinct.
```

> NOTE: If you're planning to publish on Amazon you'll want the description to no more than 4000 characters. That is why I included that limit in the prompt. 

Here is the description I'm going with - at this point anyhow.
