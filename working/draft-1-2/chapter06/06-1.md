Understanding Nash Equilibrium – Learning the concept.

Nash Equilibrium. It's named after the man himself, John Nash. But what is it?

In a nutshell, it's balance. It's when all players in a game choose their best strategy considering the strategies chosen by others. No one gains by changing only their own strategy. If each player has chosen a strategy and no player can benefit from changing strategies while the other players keep theirs unchanged, then the current set of strategy choices is a Nash equilibrium. 

Here's an example. Let's say you're developing a mobile app as a solopreneur. Your goal is to maximize downloads. You're deciding on pricing. Free, freemium, or premium. Your decision hinges on the market. What your competitors are doing. What your audience prefers. It’s not just about your preference. 

That's Nash Equilibrium for you. It's not just what you play. It's what others play too. Got it? Let's dig deeper. Up next, the implications of Nash Equilibrium.
