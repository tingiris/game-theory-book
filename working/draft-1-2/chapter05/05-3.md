Finding Your Strengths – Self-assessment for solopreneurs.

Let's find your dominant strategy. But first, you need to know your strengths. What are you best at? What sets you apart?

Perform a self-assessment. 

Be brutally honest. Find that one thing you're exceptionally good at. Maybe it's your design skills. Your impeccable service. Your innovative products. Your unbeatable prices.

Not sure? Ask around. Customers, suppliers, colleagues, partners, mentors. They often see strengths we overlook.

Certain skills are more valuable compared to others in your specific industry. Are you faster? More innovative? More reliable? Your competitive edge can be established through your most potent skill.

Your first step is to acknowledge your skills. List them all down. No strength is too small to take note of. It could be a soft skill like negotiation or a hard skill like coding. Don’t be modest here. Your honesty counts.

Next, analyze your market value. How do your skills translate into value for your customers or clients? Let's say you're an expert at digital marketing strategy. This means you can help businesses outperform competitors online, a highly valuable skill in an increasingly digital world.

Now, compare your skills with your competitors'. This will give you an idea of your unique advantages. It's also a chance to spot potential areas for improvement.

Lastly, gather external feedback. Often, we're blind to our own strengths and weaknesses. External feedback provides an outsider’s perspective. It cements our self-assessment and helps reveal any blind spots.

Identifying your strengths is key to unlocking your dominant strategy. Because armed with this knowledge, you're ready to leverage your strengths to their fullest. After all, your dominant strategy lies at the intersection of what you do excellently and what your market values most. It empowers you to meet your customers’ needs in a way no one else can.

Don't underestimate this step. It sets the stage for the strategies to come. And remember, it's not a one-size-fits-all game. The strength you identify, that's your ace. It's uniquely yours. 

Moving onto the next section, we'll discuss how to utilize your dominant strategy to always stay a step ahead. Let's get stronger in this game.
