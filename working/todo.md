# Stuff to do

## Create Front and Back Matter

Front matter and back matter are like the opening and closing credits of a book, and they play an essential role in providing context and information to readers. Let's dive into what you should include in each of them:

**Front Matter:**

1. **Title Page:** This is the very first page readers see, featuring the book's title, author's name, and often the publisher's logo.

2. **Copyright Page:** This page includes important legal and bibliographic information like the copyright date, ISBN (International Standard Book Number), publisher's contact details, and any disclaimers.

3. **Dedication:** An optional page where the author can dedicate the book to someone or something meaningful.

4. **Epigraph:** Also optional, this is a quote or a brief statement that sets the tone or theme for the book.

5. **Table of Contents:** A list of chapters or sections with page numbers, making it easy for readers to navigate the book.

6. **List of Figures/Tables:** If your book contains illustrations or tables, this is where you list them for reference.

7. **Foreword:** Written by someone other than the author, a foreword provides context or an endorsement of the book.

8. **Preface:** An introduction by the author that explains why they wrote the book, their motivation, and any background information.

9. **Acknowledgments:** Here, the author expresses gratitude to those who contributed to the book's creation or provided support.

**Back Matter:**

1. **Appendices:** Additional information that supports the content of the book but is not essential to the main narrative.

2. **Notes or Endnotes:** Citations or explanations for specific points in the book that readers can reference.

3. **Glossary:** A list of key terms and their definitions, especially useful in non-fiction or academic works.

4. **Bibliography or References:** A list of sources and materials the author used for research, providing credibility and further reading options for interested readers.

5. **Index:** An alphabetical list of topics, names, and keywords mentioned in the book, along with page numbers where they can be found.

6. **About the Author:** A brief bio of the author, highlighting their credentials or other works.

7. **Colophon:** Sometimes included, this section describes the book's production details, like the typeface, paper quality, and printing methods used.

8. **Promotional Material:** In some cases, authors or publishers include advertisements for other books or products.

Remember, not all books include every element in the front or back matter, and their placement can vary depending on the book's genre and purpose. Front matter introduces readers to the book, while back matter provides additional context and resources. Tailor the content to suit your book's specific needs and style.

## Get ISBN

Getting an International Standard Book Number (ISBN) for your book is an important step for publication and distribution. Here are the steps to obtain an ISBN:

**Step 1: Determine Your ISBN Needs**
Before you begin, decide how many ISBNs you need. Each format or edition of your book (hardcover, paperback, ebook) requires a unique ISBN. If you plan to publish multiple books, you'll need an ISBN for each title.

**Step 2: Identify the ISBN Agency in Your Country**
ISBNs are administered by different agencies worldwide. In the United States, it's managed by Bowker. In other countries, ISBN agencies exist as well. Identify the agency in your country where you'll obtain your ISBN.

**Step 3: Register for an Account**
Visit the website of your country's ISBN agency, and register for an account. You'll need to provide contact information and details about your publishing company or yourself as an author.

**Step 4: Provide Information About Your Book**
Once registered, you'll need to provide information about your book. This typically includes:
- Title
- Author(s)
- Publisher name (if applicable)
- Edition details (hardcover, paperback, ebook, etc.)
- Publication date
- Genre or category

**Step 5: Pay the Required Fee**
There is usually a fee associated with obtaining an ISBN. The cost can vary by country and the number of ISBNs you're purchasing. Be prepared to make the necessary payment during the registration process.

**Step 6: Receive Your ISBN(s)**
After payment, you will receive your ISBN(s). Each ISBN is a unique 13-digit number that identifies your book. Keep these numbers safe, as they will be used for book distribution and tracking.

**Step 7: Assign ISBNs to Your Books**
Assign the ISBN to the specific format or edition of your book. If you have multiple editions, make sure each one has a unique ISBN.

**Step 8: Include ISBN on Your Book**
Place the ISBN on the copyright page of your book, typically near the copyright information. It's a crucial element for tracking and identifying your book in the publishing and distribution process.

**Step 9: Distribute Your Book**
With your ISBN in place, you can now distribute your book to bookstores, libraries, and online retailers. The ISBN helps retailers and readers locate and order your book.

**Step 10: Keep Records**
Maintain records of your ISBNs and book details for future reference and for tracking sales and distribution.

Remember that ISBNs are essential for cataloging and selling your book in the global market. Ensure that your book is properly registered and that the ISBN is accurate to avoid any issues with distribution and sales tracking.
