# Winning Alone: Game Theory Essentials for Solopreneurs

This is a book project I’m working on for [The Dabble.AI Project](https://dabble.ai). The goal is to use generative AI to 100% write an entire book that is publish worthy - in my opinion. 

There is obviously no shortage of self-published books written by ChatGPT and other generative AI tools. But the best of them still require a ton of human editing and authoring time. The worst of them are really bad, but probably didn’t require much human effort. 

My goal is to see if I can get AI to write the entire book - without human editing or co-authoring. But hopefully, in a way that would make it impossible to tell it was not written (or heavily edited) by a human. So, I’m trying to limit my role to just creating prompts and automating steps to generate the content. I’ll also be reading the content of course, and deciding if I think the draft is worthy of being published.

I’ll track the drafts below with my comments regarding the draft’s published worthiness. I’ll do this until I either get a version that is worthy of publishing or I give up.

- [Draft 1.0](./drafts/DRAFT%201-0%20-%20Strategic%20Moves_%20Mastering%20Game%20Theory%20-%20v1.pdf) - Not worthy. Not even close. Too short, only 12 pages.
- [Draft 1.1](./drafts/DRAFT%201-1%20-%20Winning%20Alone_%20Game%20Theory%20Tactics%20for%20One-Person%20Businesses.pdf) - Not worthy. Much longer, 166 pages. Starts okay but clearly written by AI.
